Notes:
	-I fixed the trace-cutting issues on both boards (populated and unpopulated). I would definitely
	double-check to make sure I didnt miss anything.
	-Rev 2 has some fixes made to the schematic and some changes to the PCB. If you plan on printing 
	a rev 2 of this board, PLEASE CALL ME. There are a few things that we need to go over that I'm not going
	to go into detail here. It mainly invovles deleting components like the FETs that had the wrong pinout
	and then rereading the netlist so that they come in with the correct pinout. This process can be a bit
	messy with KiCAD and I would like to walk you through it personally if able. 

Major Issues:
-Switching regulator is not working correctly. It did originally but then stopped powering on.
	This could potentially be a startup issue. I was probing around at one point (with power)
	and it started working again before failing to turn on initially later after that. Due to
	time constraints, I had to leave it and just use the 2S option in the meantime. 
-Power resistor (R2?) can not handle the necessary current and blew up. It has been bypassed entirely.
	Due to trace size and copper thickness (1 oz.), only ~3A can be put through the board for cutdown.
	Unfortunately this turned out to not be the best. Either cutdown needs to be enabled for 10-15 seconds
	or a thick jumper needs to be used to increase the amount of current to something like 5-6A. 

Incorrect Nets:
-J5 (center board connector) should have power (+3.3V) and GND instead of Multiplex_A0 and A1
-Red LED pullups (R40 and R46) should go to +3.3V instead of +5V
-Backup Battery Enable Pullup (R64) Should go to +3.3V FROM BATTERY VOLTAGE DIVIDER (Use TVS diode)
	Notes: I tried doing a simple voltage divider here but that didnt work. Before startup, the Teensy
			digital pin that is tied to this voltage divider actually draws some current. That made it 
			impossible to use a pull-up to the voltage divider since there was current flowing through
			the pull-up resistor. I ended up using a TVS diode instead to create the 3.3V. 

Fill Issues:
-Q5 GND is not connected to the rest of GND

Connector Issues:
-Replace J16 (MSP430 Programming) with headers (jumpers are easier to deal with than custom programming cables)

Part Issues:
-Through-holes for 32.768kHz oscillator "Y1" are too small - had to solder them to nearby capacitors C30 and C31
-Two kinds of Green LED's (packages) - See D5 and D7
-Use the AOZ8318DI Diode packages for all TVS that is 3.3V 
-RTC schottky has a really high reverse leakage current. Replace with BAT41 (SOD123 footprint)

-Pinout for PMOS is wrong - also check NMOS (Schematic symbol issue)

Other:
-Look at voltage levels as well as current on the LTC2992
-Add series shutoff for power to the network switch to disable when the main battery fails

***RE-ANNOTATE***

Before powering board:
-Impedance check of each accessible net with respect to (WRT) to ground
-Impedance check WRT to 5V
-Impedance check WRT to 3.3V
-Look at resistances for each analog voltage divider
	-Recheck calculations for voltage division
